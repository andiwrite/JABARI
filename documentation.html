        <h1>How I Built This Website (Jabari)</h1>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>Why the Name "Jabari"?</h2>
            <p>I chose the name "Jabari" because it means "brave" or "fearless" in Swahili. I wanted the website to stand out and represent strength, reliability, and a bold approach to technology and e-commerce. The name is unique and easy to remember, which is great for branding.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>Languages Used</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML5</strong> – for the structure of all the web pages.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS3</strong> – for styling, layout, and making the site look modern and clean.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> – for interactive features like the cart, timers, and animations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I used only these core web languages so the site loads fast and works everywhere.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>Plugins and Libraries</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bootstrap 5</strong>: This is a CSS framework that helps with layout, grids, and responsive design. It made it much easier to make the site look good on phones, tablets, and computers without writing a lot of custom CSS.</li>
                <li><strong>Font Awesome</strong>: This is a library for icons (like the cart, user, and social media icons). It makes the site look more professional and user-friendly.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>What is Bootstrap?</h2>
            <p>Bootstrap is a popular open-source CSS framework that provides ready-made styles, layout grids, and components for building responsive and modern websites. It helps developers quickly create layouts that look good on all devices (phones, tablets, computers) without having to write a lot of custom CSS from scratch.</p>

        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>How Bootstrap Was Used in This Site</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The responsive grid system (rows and columns) to arrange products, categories, and sections.</li>
                <li>Navigation bars, buttons, forms, and pagination for a consistent look and feel.</li>
                <li>Making the site automatically adjust to different screen sizes.</li>
                <li>Utility classes for spacing, alignment, and colors, which made the design process faster and more reliable.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>What Was Done With the JavaScript Code</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The main JavaScript file (<code>cart.js</code>) was kept as originally written, handling cart management, cart icon updates, and interactive cart features.</li>
                <li>Inline JavaScript in the HTML files manages animations, countdown timers, wishlist toggling, sorting, and view switching.</li>
                <li>No JavaScript was removed or broken during recent edits; all interactive features remain functional.</li>
                <li>No new JavaScript was added as part of the recent changes.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>How I made the site responsive and scalable</h2>
            <p>I wanted everyone to have a good experience, whether they're on a phone, tablet, or computer. So, I used Bootstrap's grid system, which lets me arrange things in rows and columns that automatically adjust to the screen size. I also added media queries in the CSS, so things like the menu, cards, and images change their size or layout on smaller screens.</p>
            <p>For scalability, I kept the code organized and used reusable components like the header and footer on every page. I used flexible units (like %, rem, and em) so the design grows or shrinks smoothly if you zoom in or out. This way, the site can easily handle more products or new features in the future without breaking the layout.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>JavaScript Features and Algorithms</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cart Functionality</strong>: I wrote JavaScript to let users add items to the cart, change quantities, and remove items. The cart totals update automatically when you change the quantity or delete a product. This is done by listening for button clicks and updating the HTML and totals in real time.</li>
                <li><strong>Countdown Timers</strong>: The timers for deals and flash sales use JavaScript intervals to count down and update the time left every second.</li>
                <li><strong>Animations</strong>: I used Intersection Observer in JavaScript to animate cards and sections as you scroll down the page. This makes the site feel more dynamic and modern.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All the JavaScript is written in a simple way so it's easy to understand and change later.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>My Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>I started by planning the main pages and features I wanted (like Home, Products, Cart, Support, etc.).</li>
                <li>I designed the layout using Bootstrap and made sure the navigation and footer were consistent everywhere.</li>
                <li>I added real product images and made sure all links go to the right pages.</li>
                <li>I wrote the JavaScript for the cart and other interactive features.</li>
                <li>I tested the site on different devices to make sure it's responsive and easy to use.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="doc-section">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>This website was built to be fast, modern, and easy for anyone to use. I used only the most important tools and kept the code simple so it's easy to update or expand in the future. If you want to learn more or see the code, feel free to reach out!</p>
